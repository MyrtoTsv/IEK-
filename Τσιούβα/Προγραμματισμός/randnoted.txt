rand() is a function that generates a pseudo-random integer, while srand() is used to "seed" or initialize the random number generator. To get different sequences of random numbers each time a program runs, you should call srand() once at the beginning of the program to set the initial seed, and then call rand() to get the random numbers. rand() Purpose: Generates a pseudo-random integer within a specific range, typically from \(0\) to RAND_MAX.How it works: It produces a sequence of numbers based on an algorithm. Without a specific starting point, it will always produce the same sequence of numbers. srand() Purpose: Sets the starting point (the "seed") for the rand() function.How it works: It takes an unsigned integer as an argument. The rand() function uses this seed to create its initial state.When to call: It should be called only once at the beginning of the program before you start calling rand().Common usage: To get a different sequence of "random" numbers each time the program runs, you can seed the generator with the current time, for example, using srand(time(NULL)).
